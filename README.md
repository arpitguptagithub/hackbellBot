# Team BotCoders Cybersecurity Tool

## Requirements:

- Python 3.x
- Required libraries (to be specified)
- Web browser information (to be specified)

## Tech Stack Used:

- Python
- Machine Learning for binary classification
- Web crawling techniques (BFS/DFS)
- Screenshot capturing
- Regex for pattern matching

## License:

- (Specify the license under which your code is released)

## Purpose:

With the increase in the dark web selling of data, Team BotCoders has developed a cybersecurity tool to safeguard your information. The tool performs the following operations:

1. **User Safety:**
   - Checks if the user has accessed any malicious sites in the past 24 hours.
   - Utilizes a local scanning process with an inbuilt dataset of safe and unsafe sites.
   - Implements a binary classification ML algorithm to scan unidentified sites using factors like "quick change algorithm," suspicious regex, etc.

2. **Search Culprit:**
   - Implements a weighted links BFS/DFS web-based crawler for evidence collection.
   - Dynamically explores links on web pages with screenshots of suspicious activity at each dig.

3. **Check Information Safety:**
   - Crawls specific websites from a dataset, focusing on hotspots among dark web buyers.

## Future Plans:

- Make it plug and play with hardware integration.
- Track down the possible source ID of uploaders.
- Test TCP/UDP packets with user selection.
